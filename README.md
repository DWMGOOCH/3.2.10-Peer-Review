# 3.2.10-Peer-Review

Imported necessary libraries with the appropriate aliases: pd and np
Imported the DataFrame 
View the DataFrame and checked the columns to sense check

Question 1: Ran a lambda function. Ensured all indentations were correct and removed any unessecary white spaces or lines
Question 1: Also ran a user-defined function to sense check the previous result as it returned zero matches. Titled the def 'contains_fire' as an appropriate title
Used """ """ to pose the question: does the product contain Fire in the description
cf = contains_Fire
Also returned zero results 

Question 2: Ran a user-defined function with the def 'contains_candle'. Simple name relating to the purpose of the function 
Tested is the function worked using print(contains_candle(x='test_name')) 
cc = contains_candle 
Viewed the DataFrame as a whole and filtered the DataFrame for products containing candle. 178 results returned. 

Question 3: Ran another lambda function to provide the same result as a user-defined function 
Ensured all indentations and white spaces were removed

Ran both user-defined and lambda functions to improve my understanding of functions. ALso, to compare the results that both provide and which is easy to write
Summary: lambda functions are easy and neater to write (more Pythonic)
